forumhorizonchine
=================

Use Flask framework to rewrite [forumhorizonchine](http://code.google.com/p/forumhorizonchine/).

##Prerequisites
+ python( version 2.7 recommended )
+ Google App Engine Python SDK

##Installation of IDE
If you use Eclipse to develop python, use the plugin of [pydev](http://pydev.org/). I know you can install them without my guide:)

##Lib
All the required Python libs are included in the /lib folder. You don't need to install them by yourself. But if you use Eclipse and Pydev, you should add them to the path of Python Libraries. Try *Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreter - Python > Libraries*

-------
That's all, have fun with the code!
